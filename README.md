# Code Refactor Starter Code
Using the starter code for the mockup website for the marketing agency, I am responsible for the following tasks:

    1. Make the website accessible - There are several ways to do this. One way is to use semantic tags instead of divs. Semantic tags help the browser tell the user what part of the web page they are looking at.

    2. Organize style sheet - In the starter css code, there are several css rules that are not in sequential order like the html document. Put these in order.

    3. Rename selectors in style sheet - Picking a good name for selectors in the style sheet will help reduce the amount of css rules that are needed overall making the stylesheet easier to read.

About the website:

    The website helps many business owners with customers and networking. It provides services allowing the business owner to operate remotely and effectively.
